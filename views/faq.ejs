            <p>
                Rellit is a real-time chat website that connects you with people based on your location. Some of the key 
                functionalities include a feed of questions that are exclusively relevant to your 
                area and a sub-feed for replies, answers, and further discussions! Thereâ€™s also a chat feature 
                where you can meet others locally. You can explore other regions using our map that displays clusters 
                of questions to see what what's going on! 
                on!

            What's the difference between Rellit and Reddit?</h3>
            <p>
                A feed of questions and chats based specifically on your location rather than a subreddit
                is the defining distinction.

                Why is Rellit asking to use my location?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Your location is only used to determine which questions and chat messages to 
                display to make sure that the other users are also in the same area.

                Why is the chat separate from the questions page?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We provide a separate chat feature so that users can find people to do things
                with. A lot of users are people who are looking for someone to split an Uber with
                for example!

                Will other users be able to see my location or any other personal information?
            </h3>

            Do I have to sign in with Google to use Rellit?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, we do require users to sign in with their Google accounts to ensure that your information 
                stays anonymous.
